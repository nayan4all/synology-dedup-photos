# dedupPictures 📸

A blazingly fast, visually-aware photo deduplication tool built in Rust. It finds exact duplicates or visually similar photos (like WhatsApp-compressed copies) both locally on your machine and remotely over the network on a Synology NAS.

It features a beautiful interactive web-based dashboard for reviewing and confirming deletions before they happen.

## Features ✨

* **Perceptual Hashing (dHash):** Don't just find exact byte-for-byte duplicates. `dedupPictures` uses perceptual hashing to find photos that *look* the same, even if one was resized, compressed, or sent over WhatsApp.
* **Synology NAS Native:** Talks directly to the Synology DSM `FileStation` APIs. No need to mount SMB shares or pull terabytes of data over your network. It pulls tiny thumbnails directly from the NAS for blazing fast processing.
* **MFA / 2FA Support:** Fully supports Synology Secure SignIn / Multi-Factor Authentication. If you don't have MFA enabled on your NAS account, simply hit Enter when prompted—it works seamlessly with or without it.
* **Interactive Web Dashboard:** Creates a stunning, glassmorphic dark-mode web dashboard on a local server (`http://127.0.0.1:8080`) where you can visually click and toggle which images to Keep or Delete.
* **Session Persistence & Auto-save:** Accidentally closed the terminal or browser while reviewing thousands of photos? All clicks are auto-saved. Pass `--resume` to pick up exactly where you left off.
* **Parallel Processing & Caching:** Uses `rayon` to download and hash photos across all your CPU cores. Hashes are permanently cached to `~/.cache/dedupPictures/`, so second runs are nearly instant!
* **Dry Run by Default:** It will never delete anything unless you explicitly give it permission via the UI or the `--delete` flag.

## Usage 🚀

### Local Mode (Mac / PC)
Point it at a local directory on your machine:
```bash
cargo run --release -- /Users/name/Pictures --preview
```

### NAS Mode (Synology)
Point it at a shared folder path on your Synology NAS:
```bash
cargo run --release -- /home/Photos/iPhone_backup \
  --nas-host 192.168.1.100 \
  --nas-user myusername \
  --similar \
  --preview
```
*(You will be securely prompted for your DSM Password. If you have 2FA enabled, you will be prompted for your OTP code. If you don't have 2FA enabled, just press Enter to skip).*

## Flags & Options ⚙️

### Common Flags
| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--similar` | Finds visually similar pictures (using perceptual hashing) instead of exact byte-for-byte duplicates. Highly recommended for photo libraries. |
| `--threshold <N>` | The Hamming distance threshold for `--similar`. Default is `10` (out of 64 bits). Set lower (e.g. `5`) to be strict, set higher (e.g. `15`) to catch heavier compressions. |
| `--preview` | Opens the interactive visual web report in your browser for manual review. |
| `--resume` | Resumes a previous `--preview` session. Picks up your auto-saved KEEP/DELETE selections exactly where you left off. |
| `--keep <strategy>` | Determines which file in a duplicate group is marked to KEEP by default. Options: `largest` (default, good for keeping original high-res over compressed copies), `newest`, `oldest`. |
| `--delete` | Runs strictly in the terminal and automatically deletes all files marked as duplicates. Bypasses the UI. |
| `--clear-cache` | Wipes the perceptual hash cache (`~/.cache/dedupPictures/`) and forces a full re-hash of all files. |
| `--all-files` | Scans all file types instead of filtering for standard image extensions. (Useful with exact byte-for-byte deduplication). |
| `--list-shares` | (NAS Only) Queries the NAS and prints out all available root folder paths that your user has permission to scan. |

### NAS Authentication Flags
| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--nas-host <IP>` | The NAS IP or Hostname (e.g., `10.0.0.38` or `nas.local:5000`). |
| `--nas-user <USER>` | Your Synology DSM username. |
| `--nas-otp <CODE>` | (Optional) Your 6-digit Synology Secure SignIn app code. If omitted, you will be prompted interactively. If you do not have MFA enabled on your NAS, simply ignore this flag and hit Enter at the interactive prompt. |

*Note: For security, your password is never passed as a flag. The tool will always prompt you interactively.*
